Today, I released SimpleLookups v2.0.1. This version includes the following changes: 

- Some code cleanup and consistency updates.
- Added unit tests to public source code repository.
- Added script to stage a testing environment using SQL Server LocalDB.

Version 2.0.1 is now available on NuGet and on this site. Please install using Visual Studio, if possible. This way, your download counts!
