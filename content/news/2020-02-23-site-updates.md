Over the past few days, I've been working on giving SimpleLookups an actual website, instead of just having the site redirect to my blog. As of today, the new site is live, and I've moved the documentation and release announcements from my blog to this site. My blog is still available at russellwritescode.com if you're interested (you'll notice both sites use the same theme).

Speaking of documentation - the old documentation was pretty barebones and was missing a number of things, so I reorganized it and added several more pages worth to help people who would implement SimpleLookups. You can take a look at the documentation by clicking the link at the top of this page. If you still feel like something is missing, feel free to drop me an email with what you think would improve things.

There is also the issue of SimpleLookups development. I haven't been working on it for about 4 years now, and the .NET platform has evolved dramatically since then. My goal over the next six months or so is to release a new version of SimpleLookups that is .NET Core compatible and supports the new appsettings.json settings format. I expect to get started on this endeavor soon, so keep visiting the site for updates.
