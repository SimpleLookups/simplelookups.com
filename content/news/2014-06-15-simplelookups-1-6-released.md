Today, I released SimpleLookups v1.6.0. This version includes the following changes: 

New Features:
- Specify column suffixes for Name/Description/Code/Id columns.
- Specify column name of Active column.
- Specify whether or not to prepend the table name to the column names.
- Core improvements/optimizations.

Version 1.6 is now available on NuGet and on this site. I recommend NuGet, but to each their own.
