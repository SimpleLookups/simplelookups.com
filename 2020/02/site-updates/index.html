I haven&rsquo;t been working on it for about 4 years now, and the .NET platform has evolved dramatically since then. My goal over the next six months or so is to release a new version of SimpleLookups that is .NET Core compatible and supports the new appsettings.json settings format. I expect to get started on this endeavor soon, so keep visiting the site for updates.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>© 2013 - 2021
